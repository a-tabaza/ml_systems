# Problem
Ad headlines are the first interaction with potential clients, they need to be engaging.
Writing ad headlines requires a copywriter to write new headlines for every new ad asset, this is time consuming and may not result in a unique copy.

# Proposed Solution
Use generative AI to create headlines, for a copywriter, reviewing headlines instead of writing new ones saves time and effort.

# Solution at Stitch Fix

Use latent style understanding, word embeddings and few-shot learning to generate ad headlines.

## Latent Style Understanding

Create a vector space that contains embeddings for individual styles based on style profiles and ratings. Use the clusters to group styles.

## Word Embeddings
[Reference #1](https://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2015/03/11/word-is-worth-a-thousand-vectors/)

Style vectors can interop with word embeddings.

## Few-shot Learning
```
Our ad assets primarily consist of many outfit images that illustrate a wide range of styles we offer. First, we map the outfit and a set of style keywords (such as effortless, classic, romantic, professional, boho etc.) to the latent style space, and then find the style keywords closest to the outfit in that space. Next, we use GPT-3 to generate headlines based on the selected style keywords. Our human experts (copywriters) then review and edit the headlines generated by AI to ensure they capture the style of the outfit and align with the brandâ€™s tone and messaging.

# Algo-generated Product Descriptions
After testing out ad headlines, Stitch Fix is now moving on to algo-generated product descriptions.

# My Proposed Solution
Train embeddings first, then use them to query at runtime, use few-shot learning to generate headlines, but optimize for RecSys metrics using DSPy.
